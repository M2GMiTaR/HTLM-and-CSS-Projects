			<h2>Why Do Cats Sleep All Day</h2>
			<p translate="yes"> Cats sleep most of the day to conserve energy for hunting and other bursts of activity, a leftover instinct from their wild ancestors.<br>
			This behavior is also influenced by age, with kittens and senior cats typically sleeping more.<br>
			While some sleep is normal, a significant increase in sleeping could signal a health issue or emotional distress, in which case a veterinarian should be consulted.<br></p>
			
			<h3>Key Reasons for Sleeping</h3>
			<p translate="yes">
				<ul>
				<li><b>Energy Conservation:</b> Cats are predators and require a lot of energy for hunting, even for their house-cat prey like toys.<br>
					Sleeping allows them to "recharge" and store energy for these intense bursts of activity, which often occur at dawn and dusk.</li>
				<li><b>Biological Instinct:</b> Even though domestic cats are fed by humans, their bodies are still wired for the "hunt,<br> feast, sleep, repeat" cycle of their ancestors, according to Purina UK.</li>
				<li><b>Age:</b> Kittens and senior cats tend to sleep more than adult cats due to growth and potential age-related health issues, respectively. </li>
				<li><b>Health and Recovery:</b> Sleep is crucial for muscle repair, digestion, and overall health. Cats may also sleep more to recover from injuries or relieve discomfort.</li>
				<li><b>Stress and Anxiety:</b>A new or stressed environment can cause a cat to sleep more as a way to decompress and cope.</li>
				</ul>
